\title {Question to Jakki}

\begin{document}
    Goldstein (2.26) states that

    \begin{equation*}
        \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \bigg(L + \sum_{\alpha}^m \mu_a f_a \bigg) \mathrm{d}t = 0,
    \end{equation*}
    
    and jumping quickly to (2.27), he writes

    \begin{equation*}
        \d[t] \del[\dot q_k] L - \del[q_k] L = - \sum_{a = 1}^m \mu_a \del[\dot q_k] f_a.
    \end{equation*}

    We have problems following this. (2.26) suggests that \(L\) and \(\mu_a f_a\) has same dimensions. howver, the left side of (2.27) has the dimensions of \(L\) divided by the dimensions of \(q\). However, the right side has dimensions of \(L\) divided by the \(\dot q\). This makes us suspect there is something wrong with (2.27), or at least something we fundamentally missunderstand.
